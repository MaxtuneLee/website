Biome assist offers a series of actions (or rules) meant to improve code quality and DX of the users.

Contrary to linter rules, assist actions are meant for editors and IDEs, and they can include things like sorting of properties or fields, simplification of binary expressions and more. The assist has **[<NumberOfRules /> actions](/assist/actions)**.

Assist actions are very close [LSP code actions](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#codeActionKind) in semantics.
